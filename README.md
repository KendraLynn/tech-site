# tech-site
A tech related site using only HTML and CSS. Features nav bar with glowing effect on hover, animated background, neon font and animated border (About page). Links directly to articles on the web or videos on YouTube. 

The About page explains design and colour choices:
In recent years, the trend for websites has been simple, minimalistic, and using earthy or pastel palettes. Experts say these trends have been overplayed and 2023 is bringing some big changes.

Whether it's darker, more dramatic colour schemes or the use of metallics or bright neons, we'll be seeing much more colour. Trending colours for 2023: hot pinks, purples, yellows, and neons. (Pantone colour of the year: "Viva Magenta") Upcoming websites will be "busier" with more animations, scroll effects and micro-interactions, reminiscent of retro sites from the early 2000s.

Based on this info, I chose a colour palette of pink, blue, and purple on a dark background with pops of neon. I felt these colour choices worked well based on the genre, a tech info site. I used this colour palate throughout the site in all gradient effects, as well as in choosing images to create a cohesive effect. To incorporate some animation, I created gradient hover animations and animated the background.
