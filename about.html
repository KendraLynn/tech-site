<h3>Trends</h3>
  <p>In recent years, the trend for websites has been simple, minimalistic, and using earthy or 
  pastel palettes. Experts say these trends have been overplayed and 2023 is bringing some big 
  changes.</p>
  <p>Whether it's darker, more dramatic colour schemes or the use of metallics or bright neons, 
  we'll be seeing much more colour. Trending colours for 2023: hot pinks, purples, yellows, 
  and neons.
  (Pantone colour of the year: "Viva Magenta") 
  Upcoming websites will be "busier" with more animations, scroll effects and micro-interactions, 
  reminiscent of retro sites from the early 2000s.</p>
  
  <p>Based on this info, I chose a colour palette of pink, blue, and purple on a dark background with 
  pops of neon. I felt these colour choices worked well based on the genre, a tech info site.  
  I used this colour palate throughout the site in all gradient effects, as well as in choosing 
  images to create a cohesive effect. To incorporate some animation, I created gradient hover 
  animations and animated the background.
